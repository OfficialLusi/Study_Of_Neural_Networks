How neural network work? What are feed forward networks? Little classification application

This project is done by following nnfs book here : https://github.com/Sentdex/nnfs_book/blob/main/README.md https://nnfs.io/

This is an application to demonstrate how neural networks are built (in particular a feed forward network), by a classification application; it recognise a handly writed number into a digital number by using the mnist dataset.

There's also a ff neural network to show the loss function decrease and the accuracy increase.
